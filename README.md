## About Me
I am a PhD student in the Visual Information Laboratory at the University of Bristol, supervised by [Dr. Nantheera Anantrasirichai](https://david-bull.github.io/) and [Prof. David Bull](https://david-bull.github.io/). 

I completed my BSc in Computer Science and my MSc in Data Science (with Distiction), both at the University of Bristol.

My research mainly focuses on the analysis and development of techniques for enhancing low-light videos, including denoising, colourisation, contrast enhancement, and content manipulations. My work has been funded by the UKRI [MyWorld](https://www.myworld-creates.com/) Strength in Places Programme.
